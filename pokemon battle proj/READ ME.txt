hi this is my first GitHub project
did it in about 2 weeks

Requirements:
jupyter notebook
pandas,matplotlib modules

About the game:
this is a 1v1 Pok√©mon battler versus a computer. If you don't know much about pokemon well the main parts are that there are multiple types of status effects like fire and ice and water etc. Each type has a strength and a weakness, In this game, you select a type and battle against the computers type to see how u come out on top.

How to play:
Press run and enter a type, you will get shown a name of ur pokemon.
the computer will also randomly choose a pokemon.

The first battle starts purely based on effectiveness, if one pokemon completely counters the other, game ends there and shows the stats of each.

If no pokemon counter each other then you go into a final battle where the total of each pokemons stats(hp,def,spd,atk) are added up and calculated and whoever has the higher wins.
